# MSA-Project-2-Report

Creating a wordpress website hosted on Azure Cloud was very straightforward given the instructions provided.

Theme:

It is possible to customise the website using front-end code such as HTML and CSS, 
but given my experience I found it much easier to work with a theme to get the overall layout and colours desired.

SEO Plugin: Rank Math SEO

When creating posts and entries, Rank Math rated the page and gave suggestions to make the page more optimal for SEO purposes. 
This was really useful as a student new to the field of SEO and personal blogs.
It was very interesting to experiment with different key words and phrases which optimised the overall post.

Analytics Plugin: Analytify

Easily accessed dashboard, chosen because of simplicity and good reviews.

Cache Management Plugin: WP-Optimize

Going through the various plugins for cache management, WP-Optimise contained language that was easiest to understand what the plugin actually achieved.
Looking at the optimizations and options available after installation, it was very simple and easy to use.
